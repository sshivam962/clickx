%p.text-doc.txt-jstfy
  We require a minimum of 2 hours of time invested each day in order to get your business new customers and generate revenue. Depending on your speed and technical abilities, you may require additional time.  Each week (a “documented week”), you are required to submit a timesheet which sets forth an itemization of the time you invested each day of the prior week and the activities you worked on during that time. Each timesheet must be submitted no later than Wednesday of the week after the documented week (i.e., five calendar days after the documented week ends). If you fail to timely submit detailed timesheets, or fail to meet the 2-hour minimum daily time-spend requirement, you will be ineligible for the money back guarantee.

%h4.ptb-25 PART 3: Live Coaching Calls
%p.text-doc.txt-jstfy
  We require you attend a minimum of 2 coaching calls per week. We offer coaching calls on Lead Generation and Sales. Our coaches dedicate their time in training, answering questions, and getting you any help LIVE during the call. If you cannot attend a call, you must provide 24-hour notice in advance of the call. You are permitted to miss a total of 2 of the scheduled calls in the 90-day timeframe.  Failure to give proper notice of your intended absence, or absence from more than 2 calls will make you ineligible for the money back guarantee.

%h4.ptb-25 PART 4: Lead Generation Activities:
%p.text-doc.txt-jstfy
  In order to generate 3 sales meetings a day, you must reach out to leads provided by Clickx as well as personally researched leads.  Our research and experience tells us that if you want 1 booked meeting per day, you must reach out to 100 businesses via Call, Text, Facebook Page, and submit a form on their website. In order to get to 2 booked meetings per day, you have to reach out to 200 businesses.

  Use this methodology to increase the number of booked appointments. While outbound prospecting is not difficult, it is time-consuming. Typical appointment setters make 300 outbound dials per day.   The higher the number of calls per day, the higher the likelihood of you getting a sale. You may wish to hire a virtual assistant to do this on your behalf. You must submit a detailed activity log showing all outbound prospecting activities to confirm compliance with our process.

  You may alternatively run YouTube Ads or Facebook Ads to increase the awareness of your agency. Ads budget is not included in any of our programs you are responsible for the ad spend yourself.
  In addition to verified email addresses that Clickx provides, we also include a Business Facebook profile for many of the businesses. To be eligible for the money back guarantee, you must reach out to a minimum of 100 Facebook business pages per day.

%h4.ptb-25 PART 5: KPI Sheet
%p.text-doc.txt-jstfy
  We will provide a KPI sheet which lists a set of specific activities. This Google doc created for you must be the form you turn in with your tracked activities. You are strictly prohibited from creating duplicates or copies. You must fill out the form contemporaneously with each day’s activities in order to ensure compliance. Failure to complete the form each day as required will make you ineligible for the money back guarantee.

  In order to generate a brand for your agency, we require you to create one piece of content that is image, text, or video on one of your profiles of choice. This could be on Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, etc. You must paste the link to your post in our Slack Engagement Group so that others may like, comment, and give you additional exposure for your agency. Ensure that you create one piece of content per day, ensure you post on the slack channel daily Monday through Friday on a consistent basis.

%p.text-doc.txt-jstfy
  We provide a Slack channel with other Partners who are in the program on which you have the ability to ask us questions. We may have our coaches answer you, or other Partners will answer. If you do not engage in the slack channel, we will assume that you have no questions which means you are well on your way to booking 2 or 3 meetings per day!

%h4.ptb-25 No Extension of Time
%p.text-doc.txt-jstfy
  The program is a strict 90-day timeline, and the 90-days must be contiguous 90-days without any pauses, extensions or modifications for any reason. The money back guarantee will be applied in the form of credit you can use towards our software subscription. You will be able to apply the credit to any of the agency subscriptions available.  If you wish to continue partnering with us, and for some reason are unable to complete the 90-day program without interruption, you will need to purchase one of our agency subscription plans.
